title: 
summary: I am a political scientist from Portugal. My main interests are on the fields of political behavior and political culture, with a geographical focus on Europe. I am currently a Postdoctoral Prize Research Fellow in Politics at Nuffield College, University of Oxford.
The bulk of my research focuses on the creation and erosion of social norms against behavior associated with authoritarianism. My work explores how democracies create a political culture that deems authoritarianism socially unacceptable, and how such culture can change. I am very eager to incorporate insights from social psychology and behavioral economics, as well as novel measures and data sources, into my work.
