summary: I am a first-gen political scientist from Mollet del Vall√®s, Barcelona (Spain). I am a Ph.D. student at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences) of Florence (Italy) under the supervision of Professor Elias Dinas. Professor Miriam Golden is my second co-supervisor. <br> <br> My research focuses on political behavior in the aftermath of conflict and authoritarian regimes. My work explores how different experiences of conflict resolution, violence, and authoritarian repression determine political behavior in authoritarian and democratic regimes. <br> <br> I am interested in quantitative techniques, especially in causal inference designs. I also aim to use original data. I employed original archival data in some of my work. An example of this is my project on the consequences of Francoist repression on political behavior in Galicia, Spain. I have also participated in designing surveys and intensive data collection fieldwork at different levels of aggregation. An instance of such is my joint work with Professor Dinas and Dr. Valentim on public expressions of national identity in several European countries. <br> <br> I also have a keen interest in topics determining social and memory policies. <br> <br> My research has been featured at [Kathimerini](https://www.ekathimerini.com/opinion/239359/has-the-prespes-accord-increased-nationalist-sentiments/). <br> <br> You can follow my lamentations on F.C. Barcelona on twitter at [@sergisme](https://twitter.com/Sergisme)
