summary: I am a political scientist from Mollet del Vall√®s, Barcelona. I work at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences) of Florence (Italy) under the supervision of Professor Elias Dinas. Professor Miriam Golden is my second co-supervisor. <br> <br> My research explores how different experiences of conflict resolution, violence, and authoritarian repression determine political behavior in authoritarian and democratic regimes. <br> <br> I am interested in quantitative methods, especially causal inference designs. I fancy using original data in my work. I have participated in designing survey instruments and intensive data collection fieldwork on novel measures of political behavior like, for instance, in public expressions of national identity. I also enjoy gathering, digitalizing, and working with archival data, as in my projects on the consequences of Francoist repression on political behavior in Galicia and the Basque Country. <br> <br> I also have a keen interest in topics determining social and memory policies. <br> <br> My research has been featured at [Kathimerini](https://www.ekathimerini.com/opinion/239359/has-the-prespes-accord-increased-nationalist-sentiments/), in Greece, [GREO.ca](https://www.greo.ca/Modules/EvidenceCentre/Details/the-social-harm-of-new-betting-houses-on-high-school-students-academic-performan), in Canada, and [elDiario.es](https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/abrir-casas-apuestas-cerca-institutos-baja-rendimiento-escolar-barrios-humildes_1_8440297.html), [Cadena Ser](https://cadenaser.com/ser/2021/10/31/sociedad/1635675473_674477.html) and [RTVE](https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20211107/casas-apuestas-proximidad-colegios-barrios/2211660.shtml), in Spain. <br> <br> You can follow my lamentations on F.C.
