summary: I am a firstgen political scientist from Mollet del Vall√®s, Barcelona (Spain). I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences) of Florence (Italy) under the supervision of professor Elias Dinas. Professor Miriam Golden is my second co-supervisor. <br> <br> My research focuses on post-conflict and authoritarian regimes' political behavior. My work explores how distinctive experiences of conflict resolution, violence, and authoritarian repression or policies determine political behavior during and after democratic transitions. <br> <br> My work has been featured at the X.
