I am a 3rd-year PhD student in Political Science at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/government). I use formal theory to study Political Economy. 

More specifically, using models of Political Agency and Lobbying, I consider how transparency regulations and voter’s rationality influence the behaviour of politicians and special interest groups.

From September 2021 to June 2022 I am visiting the [NYU Wilf Family Department of Politics](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/politics.html).
